# Jupyter Desktop Server with pymol installed

This was originally meant to be able to run `pymol_preview_generator.py` from [here](https://github.com/mmagnus/rna-tools/tree/master/rna_tools/tools/pymol_preview_generator); however, the XFCE desktop doesn't seem to allow the icons to be changed (even using `gio set`), and so that was **a dead-end effort for now**. However, since PyMOL does at leat work in the desktop GUI, I am leaving it in this state for now in case a use case arises later.

Run XFCE (or other desktop environments) on a JupyterHub.

This is based on https://github.com/ryanlovett/nbnovnc and a fork of https://github.com/manics/jupyter-omeroanalysis-desktop
